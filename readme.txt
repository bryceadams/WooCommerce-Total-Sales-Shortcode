Show off your site's total sales or a percent of its sales with a simple shortcode!

== Description ==

You may want to show off your site's total sales or a percent of its total sales on the front-end of your site. This plugin adds a new shortcode `[wctss_total_sales]`, that will do just that!

**Example Use:**

* Show off your site's total sales
* You donate a percent of your site's sales to charity - easily display the dynamic amount that has been donated
* You want to brag to your customers how much money you're making
* You want to show your customers that you're not selling anything and as such, need their money more than ever
* I don't know

**Using the Shortcode:**

The Shortcode: `[wctss_total_sales]`

The shortcode has three optional attributes:

* `percent` - integer: eg. **10**, would display 10% of your total sales
* `before` - string, **$** by default: eg. **฿**, would display ฿35,000 (if your total sales were 35,000)
* `after` - string: eg. **Total Sales**, you may want to add an empty space before so there's a gap between the amount and this text

**So for example:**

```
[wctss_total_sales percent="50" before="€" after=" Donated to My Comic Book Collection!"]
```

**Would display:**

```
€5,250.42 Donated to My Comic Book Collection!
```

Awesome! Right? I hope so...
